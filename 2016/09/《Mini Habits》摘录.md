* Big intentions are worthless if they don't bring results.
* People have been shown in studies to chronically overestimate their self-control ability.
* Doing a little bit is infinitely bigger and better than doing nothing (mathematically and practically speaking).
* Doing a little bit every day has a greater impact than doing a lot on one day. How much greater? Profoundly so, because a little bit every day is enough to grow into a lifelong foundational habit, and those are a big deal, as you'll see.
* A mini habit is basically a much smaller version of a new habit you want to form.
* The foundation of the Mini Habits system is in “stupid small” steps.
* The power of the Mini Habits system is in the application, mindset, built-in positive feedback looping, naturally increasing self-efficacy, and of course, leveraging small steps into habits.
* The way we act on these mini habits is by using a small amount of willpower to force ourselves to do them.
* A bank may be too big to fail, but mini habits are too small to fail; and so they lack the common destructive feelings of guilt and inadequacy that come with goal failure.
* The human brain is slow-changing and stable; it has routines and a framework that allow it to respond consistently to the world.
* The Mini Habits strategy is forcing yourself to take 1-4 “stupid small” strategic actions every day. These actions are too small to fail, and too small to skip for special occasions.
* The Mini Habits strategy is forcing yourself to take 1-4 “stupid small” strategic actions every day. These actions are too small to fail, and too small to skip for special occasions. They serve dual purposes—to spark you to do more, and to become (mini) habits.
* You must embrace this mini-requirement as if it is a full goal.
